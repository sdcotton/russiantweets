ECE 143 Project Group 5.

## Proposal

We are interested in finding common features (e.g. frequency of words, phrases,
misspellings) of these tweets, how these tweets talked about different
candidates in different ways and identifying patterns of behavior. The results
of this project could help people identify fake news and prevent them from
affecting elections.

## Method

We will be using histograms, bar charts and static word clouds to give a visual
comparison of genuine and fake tweets in order to identify outliers that may
help identify a Russian Twitter Troll

## Dataset

*[NBC News 200,000 known Russian twitter bot/troll tweets](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731 "NBC News")

*[Ed King's Election Day 300,000 tweet dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/election-day-tweets#election_day_tweets.csv "Kaggle")
Unarchive the "russian-troll-tweets.zip" file and use the "tweets.csv" as the dataset.

## Scripts

*clean_data.py: extracts tweets from datasets and extracts useful data to analyze

*process_data.py: contains functions that analyze and compare the cleaned data

*show_results.py: displays the results of the analysis in a variety of ways
